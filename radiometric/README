HDR Imaging & Radiometric Calibration
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Goal: I want to combine a bunch of images taken at different exposures
Technical goal: Recover a camera response function relating pixel intensity
                and exposure to a linearized radiance value

These are a set of MATLAB tools to perform radiometric calibration for the
purpose of processing high dynamic range (HDR) images.

--------------------------------
Recovering the response function
--------------------------------
   PART 1: Capturing Raw Data
--------------------------------
Find a scene and camera position such that the image has a high dynamic
range visible without moving the camera. (An outdoor scene is recommended)

Option 1: Using an OpenNI2-compatible camera
    Run the data_grabber application with an image output folder and an
    imagelist file:
      $ data_grabber images/ imagelist.txt
Option 2: Other camera
    Take several images at each exposure level, without moving the camera.
    It is recommended to average a few images at each exposure level to reduce
    the effects of noise.

    Create a text file containing the list of image names and the exposures
    they were taken at:
    E.g. imagelist.txt, containing 3 lines
     
        image1.png 0.33
        image2.png 0.66
        image3.png 1.00 
         
    etc.

Recovering the response function
--------------------------------
 PART 2: Computing the function
--------------------------------
Run the following command in MATLAB or octave. Use an appropriate value for
lambda; here we have lambda=42
      $ matlab
         > g = makehdr('imagelist.txt', 42);
         > save('response.mat', 'g');

-----------------------------------------------------------
Use Case 1: Converting a set of images into radiance images
-----------------------------------------------------------
 1. Capture images and record their exposure values
 2. Create a text file with a list of the images and their exposures, as before
 3. Run the following command in MATLAB or octave.
      $ matlab
         > load('response.mat');
         > batchconverthdr('imagelist.txt', g);
    This will create one file for each input image. The filenames will simply be
    the input filenames with a .hdr appended.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Use Case 2: Recover a single HDR image from a set of aligned images
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Capture images and record their exposure values
 2. Create a text file with a list of the images and their exposures, as before
 3. Run the following command in MATLAB or octave.
      $ matlab
         > load('response.mat');
         > image = converthdrstack('imagelist.txt', g);
         > pfs_write_image(image, 'outputfile.hdr');
